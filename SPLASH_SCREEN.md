## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Component: `SplashScreen.tsx`
**Props:**
```typescript
interface SplashScreenProps {
  onComplete: (theme: 'light' | 'dark') => void;
}
```

**State Management:**
- `isVisible` - Controls splash screen visibility
- `isAnimating` - Triggers staggered animations
- `selectedTheme` - Tracks user's theme choice

**Storage:**
- `sessionStorage.hasSeenSplash` - Prevents showing again this session
- `localStorage.theme` - Persists theme choice

### Integration: `ClientBody.tsx`
- Wraps entire app
- Shows splash on first mount
- Applies theme to `<html>` element
- Seamless with existing ThemeContext

### Animation Timeline:
```
0ms    → Splash screen appears
300ms  → Logo animates in
600ms  → "Powered by DEEP" text appears
800ms  → Theme selection cards appear
1000ms → "Click to enter" hint appears
[user clicks]
500ms  → Fade out
Done   → App reveals
```

---

## 🌓 Theme Behavior

### Initial Selection:
1. User selects theme on splash screen
2. Theme applied to `document.documentElement`
3. Choice saved to localStorage
4. Splash screen fades out

### Subsequent Visits:
1. Splash screen checks sessionStorage
2. If seen this session → skip splash
3. Theme loaded from localStorage
4. Header theme toggle still works

### Theme Toggle:
- Existing ThemeContext still functional
- Users can change theme anytime via header
- Splash screen theme = initial preference
- Header toggle = runtime switching

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Desktop:
- Large logo (128px × 128px)
- Spacious theme cards
- Full animations visible
- Comfortable spacing

### Mobile:
- Responsive logo size
- Theme cards side-by-side
- Touch-friendly buttons (large hit areas)
- Optimized text sizes
