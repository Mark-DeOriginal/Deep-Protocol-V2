# Waitlist & Early Access System

## Overview
The Deep Protocol deposits are locked for now with a waitlist/early access system. Users can browse the aggregator, view pool details, and sign up to be notified when deposits go live.

## Implementation

### 1. Coming Soon Modal (`src/components/ComingSoonModal.tsx`)
A beautiful modal that appears when users try to add liquidity:

**Features:**
- 🎨 Modern gradient design matching Deep Protocol branding
- 🔒 Lock icon indicating feature is coming soon
- ✅ Lists upcoming features (one-click deposits, yield tracking, etc.)
- 👤 Integration with existing auth system
- 📝 Two states:
  - **Not Authenticated**: Shows "Sign Up for Early Access" button
  - **Authenticated**: Shows "You're on the waitlist!" confirmation

**User Flow:**
1. User clicks "Get Early Access" button
2. Modal appears with coming soon message
3. If not signed in → redirects to `/signup` to join waitlist
4. If signed in → shows confirmation they're on the waitlist

### 2. Updated Pool Detail Page (`src/app/pools/[id]/page.tsx`)
**Changes Made:**
- ❌ Removed all deposit functionality (wallet address, SOL sending, etc.)
- ✅ Added "Interested in Providing Liquidity?" section
- 📊 Kept earnings calculator for user planning
- 🔘 Replaced "Add Liquidity" with "Get Early Access" button
- 🎯 Shows waitlist messaging

**What Users See:**
- Full pool statistics (APR, TVL, Volume, Fees)
- Token information and addresses
- Earnings calculator to estimate potential returns
- "Get Early Access" button that opens the modal
- Message: "Deposits coming soon. Join the waitlist!"

### 3. Updated Pools Listing Page (`src/app/pools/page.tsx`)
**Changes Made:**
- Updated CTA button text from "View Details" → "View Details & Get Early Access"
- Changed secondary button from "Add on Raydium" → "Trade on Raydium"
- All pool data remains 100% real from Raydium API

## User Experience Flow

}
```

### Authentication Integration:

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **User Engagement**: Users can explore and plan before deposits launch
2. **Waitlist Building**: Capturing interested users for launch day
3. **Data Collection**: Users sign up with email for notifications
4. **Trust Building**: Transparent about feature availability
5. **Professional UX**: Clean, honest communication about roadmap
6. **SEO & Discovery**: Pools are indexed and discoverable
7. **Market Research**: See which pools users are most interested in

## Future Enhancements

When deposits go live, you can:
1. Remove the `ComingSoonModal` component
2. Re-enable deposit functionality in pool detail pages
3. Update button text back to "Add Liquidity"
4. Send email notifications to waitlist users
5. Announce launch to all signed-up users

## Notification Strategy

Users on the waitlist have:
- ✅ Email addresses (from signup)
- ✅ Wallet addresses (from signup)
- ✅ Names (from signup)

When launching:
1. Email all users: "Deep Protocol Deposits Are Live! 🚀"
2. Offer early access period for waitlist users
3. Provide bonus incentives for early depositors
4. Track which pools users viewed (analytics)
