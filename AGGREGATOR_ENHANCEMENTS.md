2. **Advanced Metrics Bar** - Shows technical sophistication
3. **APR Trend Indicators** - Dynamic, engaging
4. **Smart Sorting** - Improves usability
5. **Pool Comparison** - Unique differentiator

These can be implemented in 4-6 hours and will make the aggregator feel significantly more professional and tech-heavy.

Would you like me to implement any of these features?
